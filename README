A simple asynchronous complete plugin, it will run simply and silently in background :)

Depends:
 - vim 7.3.196 or later
 - +python feature
 - +clientserver feature (optional)

 * asynccompl only supports ASCII completion of the current buffer currently

Options:
 * g:asynccompl_autostart_filetype  default: ['all']
    asynccompl will autostart in these filetype, and the 'all' means always start

 * g:asynccompl_autostop_filetype   default: []
    asynccompl will stop in these filetype

Suggestions:
 - If you wish always start asynccompl, just not need to configure.

 - If you wish just start asynccompl in c, cpp filetype, just add the follow to your .vimrc
    let g:asynccompl_autostart_filetype = ['c', 'cpp']

 - If you wish just stop asynccompl in c, cpp filetype, just add the follow to your .vimrc
    let g:asynccompl_autostop_filetype = ['c', 'cpp']
